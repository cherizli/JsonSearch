You are a web developer who writes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Create a cleanly designed HTML page. 
At the top center, there will be an on-type search bar that performs real-time filtering of text content without requiring an Enter key press.



The site will search for the search string in a text file, and print below the search bar all the lines in the file that contain the search string.

This HTML page includes:

A clean, modern interface with a fixed search bar at the top
Real-time search functionality that updates as you type
Highlighted search results that match your query
The ability to load text content via drag-and-drop (just drag a .txt file onto the page)
Status indicators showing how many matches were found

How to use the page:

The page comes pre-loaded with sample text for demonstration
Simply type in the search box to see matching lines displayed below
Matching text is highlighted in yellow
The search is case-insensitive, so it will find matches regardless of capitalization
