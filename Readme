You are a web developer who writes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Creat A cleanly designed, modern interface HTML Page.
On the top center there will be with a fixed search bar.
there will be an on-type search bar that performs real-time filtering of text content without requiring an Enter key press.
The search bar is a Real-time search functionality that updates as you type.
Add a CHECK-BOX to the right of the search bar that will determine whether to search for all words in the query
(the order does not matter) or at any of them.

The site will search for the search string in a JSON file at this address:
https://github.com/cherizli/JsonSearch/raw/refs/heads/main/283.json

the JSON file contains data with the following structure:
o: Unique identifier
f: First name
l: Last name
v: Voter ID
p: Phone number (possibly empty)
a: Address
s: Status (0 in all cases)
t: Another status (0 in all cases)
vo: Boolean (false in all cases)
ci: City ID

It will print below the search bar all the object in the JSON file that the query match one (or more) of the keys:
First Name (f), Last Name (l), Voter ID (v), Address (a), City ID (ci) 

Status indicators showing how many matches were found.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Code is working, still Update the code:
Remove the Debug Tools.
On the Result Display, don't display the 'p: Phone number' filed.
On the Result Display, don't display the 'o: Unique identifier' filed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The code works as expected. Still need to update the code on the following issues:
Add a "איתורון" title above the search bar.
update the HTML file name without the word 'voters'.
update the file location in the fetch function to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cherizli/JsonSearch/refs/heads/main/283.json
Change the Result Display to lines.
